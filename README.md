# Simple Calculator
This is a basic calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on two numbers.

## Features:
- Performs basic arithmetic operations.
- Handles division by zero errors with informative messages.
- Provides clear user interface with labels, entry fields, and buttons.

## How to Run:
- **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3 and Tkinter installed.
- **Download**: Clone or download the repository containing the calculator.py file.
- **Run**: Open a terminal in the project directory and execute the script using python calculator.py.

## Further Enhancements:
- Implement additional mathematical functions (e.g., exponentiation, square root).
- Add memory functionality (store previous results).
- Improve the user interface with features like history or scientific notation.
